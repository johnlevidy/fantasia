# fantasia

Little web server which takes a json, csv, or clipboard copy from google sheet project description ( tsv ) and uses graphviz to render a nice DAG vivew. 

Also computes a few helpful metrics like parallelism ratio and indicates items which have to be started imminently in order to meet completion deadlines ( based on existing estimates ).
