## TODO / Hygiene

move everything to networkx
function renaming around  compute_dag_metrics, etc..

## Features

1. Indicate in some way an item hasn't started yet but should have ( add notification for this as well )
2. Make items that come N days after the furthest out in progress completion date smaller or less visible
5. Clearly indicate which items are complete ( requires agreeing on schema on status with the spreadsheet )
6. Filtering on the type of the notification
7. Item that's started when prereq isn't done?
